[Sentiment Analysis of Twitter using Word Embeddings in Python ](https://github.com/masdeval/NLP/blob/master/FinalProject/SentimentAnalysisWord2Vec.pdf)<p>
Today’s Internet content is largely made from unstructured data, mostly
images and text. Part of the text content is in form of comments made by
users giving their impressions about virtually everything. Processing natural
language text documents is still a challenging task due to its ambiguity and
context dependency. Nevertheless, being able to extract useful information
from this source is highly desirable due to its market value. Understand
better people’s feeling about a matter, customer needs, or product’s quality,
are just some of the possibilities by accomplishing this task. In this work,
we evaluate the performance of machine learning and natural language pro-
cessing techniques in the task of classifying sentiment in tweets.
