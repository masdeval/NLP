This file describes the word lists used for AdaBoost
in the subjectivity detection approach described in:

Multilingual Sentiment Analysis on Social Media
E. Tromp

This folder contains positive, negative and negation
words for both English and Dutch. The positive word
lists contain words that have a positive prior
polarity. The negative word lists contain words
having a negative prior polarity. The negation word
lists contain words that flip polarity through
negating prior polarity words.

The following description is taken from the thesis.

Supported by the results of Section 3.3.1, we use 50 weak learners and POS-tags combined with a prior
polarity lexicon for features. The prior polarity lexicons contain positive, negative and negation words. In
addition to the presence of POS-tags we have one additional feature indicating the presence of exactly one
positive word (weak positiveness) and one feature indicating the presence of multiple positive words (strong
positiveness). We also have two identical features for the negative case. Whenever a positive or negative
word is directly preceded by a word from the negation list, its polarity is flipped.
