Multilingual Sentiment Analysis on Social Media
E. Tromp

The folder contains numerous files named according to
a regular scheme. There are three files for both
English and Dutch, containing either positive,
negative or objective messages. For each message there
is both a tag file as well as a token file. The
tokens on a line of one file correspond to the
tags on the same line number of the corresponding
tag file.

The naming scheme is as follows
{tokens,tags}_{en_UK,nl_NL}_{hyves,twitter,facebook}_{pos,neg,obj}.txt
Here tokens or tags either indicate whether the
the file contains tokens or tags. The second set
is the language code, being either en_UK for English
or nl_NL for Dutch. The third set indicates the
social medium the messages originate from. The
fourth set is the label of the file, being
either positive, negative or objective.

The following description is taken from the thesis.

3.2.4 Validation Set
Goal 1 requires us to compare dierent approaches to the same problem with each other. Since little data
often implies weak conclusions, we require a large yet accurate dataset to evaluate upon. To this end we use
the validation set shown in Figure 6.

To create this validation set, we use a part of the data described in Section 3.2.1 to achieve Goal 4. We
do this by selecting exactly 500 messages per social medium labeled Dutch by our language identification
algorithm. We do the same for English. We manually inspect this label and if it indeed is Dutch or English,
we manually determine whether it is a positive, negative, bipolar or objective message. If we are unsure
about the true sentiment, the message is left out. As part of speech tags are merely used as features and
we do not experiment with the POS-tagger, we do not manually construct these. We rather let our part of
speech tagging algorithm determine the tag. This is not a problem as we do not evaluate POS-tagging.

The resulting size of the validation set as used to achieve Goal 1 is shown in Table 9. Note that the varying
sizes of the validation set with respect to social medium and language is due to our certainty of messages
actually being what we label them. Facebook for example contains a lot of lengthy messages with a lot of
slang in them. This prevents a human being from accurately determining the sentiment of the message.

From our labeling, it turned out that Facebook contained very little Dutch messages. Likewise, Hyves hardly
contained any English messages, the English messages that were present were most often cited from Twitter.
Due to these observations, we decided not to include Dutch Facebook messages nor English Hyves messages
into our validation set.

Note that we have bipolar messages our validation set. Since we do not have a proper way to obtain such
messages in an automated way, this type of messages is not present in our training set and hence our models
cannot take this into account. Even though for our problem formulation, we do not care about the bipolar
class, we will propose some heuristics to deal with this whenever possible to demonstrate possible ways to
incorporate this class.

Table 9 - The sizes of the training and validation set. As we cannot determine whether a message is bipolar or not, the bipolar
class is missing in the training set. The dierent sizes for each language and social medium of the validation set is because we
only include messages of which we are sure the label is correct.
